For the insuranceEDA file, below is the data:[insurance.csv](https://github.com/Teddybrian/Machine-Learning/files/10611146/insurance.csv)
The insuranceEDA performs the following steps:
Imports several modules to be used in EDA like: pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, numpy, norm from scipy, StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing and stats from scipy
Reads dataset from repository
Checks for missing values (the data sethas no missing values)
Performs descriptive statistical summary of the dataset
Performs univariate analysis on the dataset producing the histograms and checking skewness and kurtosis of all the variables in the data set
Standardizes the 'charges' varaible
Performs bivariate analysis on 'charges/age'
Performs correlation matrix
Produces a scatterplot of the variables in the dataset


For the Linear Regression file, it performs the following:
importing necessary libraries, loadds dataset, visualizes data using correlation matrix,encodes categorical data, splits dataset into Test and Training data, fits in multiple linear regression to the training data, predicts test data from results acquired, evaluated the model using R squared, Mean Abolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
